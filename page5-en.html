                    In aquaculture production systems, water quality is the most important factor influencing fish health and performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    What the fish want, not what we think the fish want, is referred to as good water quality.
                    This means that we must thoroughly understand the water quality requirements of the fish in culture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fish live in water and are completely reliant on it for all of their needs.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    Different fish species require a unique set of water quality parameters (temperature, pH, oxygen concentration, salinity, hardness, and so on) to survive, grow, and reproduce.
                    Each species has its own optimum range, or the range in which it performs best, within these tolerance limits. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is therefore critical for fish producers to ensure that the physical and chemical conditions of the water remain as close to the optimum range of the fish under culture as possible at all times.

            <h2>1. Why Water Quality is Important</h2>
            <p>Aquatic animals breathe and feed inside water — so it must be clean, balanced, and stable.<br> Water quality affects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Oxygen levels
                </li>
                <li>
                    Growth and immunity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Feed intake
                </li>
                <li>
                    Disease risk
                </li>
                <li>
                    Good water quality = healthy pond = higher profit.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    pH	6.5 - 8.5	Balances biological activity

                <li>
                    Dissolved Oxygen (DO)	Above 5 ppm	Required for fish to breathe

                    Temperature	25°C - 32°C	Affects metabolism
                    Ammonia	Near 0 ppm	Toxic waste product
                    Alkalinity	80 -200 ppm	Stabilizes pH
                    Turbidity	30 - 50 cm (Secchi Disk)	Controls sunlight and plankton growth

            <h2>3. What is pH in Pond Water?</h2>
            <p>pH is a measure of how acidic or alkaline your pond water is.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Low pH less then (6.5): Acidic - harmful to fish
                </li>
                <li>
                    High pH (>8.5): Alkaline – causes stress and poor growth
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ideal Range: 6.5 to 8.5
                </li>

            <h2>4. How to Test pH</h2>
            <p>You can use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>pH strips (dip in water, check color)</li>
                <li>
                    Digital pH meter (more accurate)

                </li>
                <li>
                    Water test kits (includes pH, ammonia, etc.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tip: Test early morning and afternoon — pH changes during the day due to plankton activity.
