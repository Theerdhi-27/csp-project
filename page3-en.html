          <h2>1. Introduction to Aquaculture</h2>
          <p>Aquaculture, also known as aquafarming or aquiculture, is the controlled cultivation of aquatic organisms such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fish</li>
            <li>Shrimps and crustaceans</li>
            <li>Mollusks (like oysters and mussels)</li>
            <li>Algae and aquatic plants (e.g., lotus)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It involves the breeding, growing, and harvesting of these organisms in freshwater, brackish water, or marine environments ‚Äî just like farming, but in water.
            Aquaculture provides a sustainable food source and helps in restoring endangered species. Due to growing demand for seafood, new technologies now support fish farming even in coastal marine waters and oceans.</p>
           <h3>üîç Types of Aquafarming</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>üêü Fish farming</li>
            <li>ü¶ê Crustacean farming</li>
            <li>üêö Mollusk farming</li>
            <li>üåø Farming of aquatic plants and algae</li>
          </ul>

            <h2> 2. How to Start Aquaculture Farming</h2>
            <p>Starting aquaculture involves proper planning and understanding of local conditions. 
            First, identify a suitable location with good water availability and access. 
            Prepare the land by digging ponds or constructing tanks.
            You'll need to invest in seed (fish/shrimp), feed, water management tools, and sometimes electricity
            for aerators.Also, look into local government schemes (like PMMSY) that offer financial support or training.
            It's important to get advice from local fisheries officers before starting.</p>

            <h2>3. Species Selection</h2>
            <p>Choosing the right species depends on the climate, water quality, and your budget.Some popular species are:<br>
            Fish: Rohu, Catla, Mrigal, Tilapia, Pangasius<br>
            Shrimp: Vannamei, Black Tiger (in coastal areas)
            </p>

            <h2>4. Pond Construction & Design</h2>
            <p>Well-designed ponds lead to better growth and easier management. Ponds can be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Earthen ponds (common in villages)</li>
                <li>Cement tanks (used for hatcheries or small-scale farming)</li>
                <li>Lined ponds (with plastic sheets to avoid leakage)</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="section">
            <h2> 5. Water Quality Management</h2>
            <p>Good water is the backbone of successful aquaculture. Regularly check:
            pH (ideal: 6.5 to 8.5),Dissolved oxygen (above 5 ppm),
            Temperature (25¬∞C to 32¬∞C),Ammonia (should be near zero)Use test kits to monitor weekly. Add lime, probiotics, or minerals based on the results. 
            Clean water ensures fast growth and prevents diseases.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Feeding & Nutrition</h2>
           <p>Feed your fish or shrimp based on their size and age. Use floating or sinking feed from reputed brands.
             Avoid overfeeding as it pollutes the water.
            </p>
            <p>Tip: Feed in the morning and evening. Observe eating behavior if they are not eating well,
             check water quality or signs of disease.
            </p>

            <h2> 7. Health & Disease Management</h2>
            <p>Aquatic species can suffer from bacterial, viral, or fungal infections.
            Common signs include:Reduced feeding,Red spots or wounds,Lethargy or swimming at surface
            To prevent disease:Maintain good water quality,Do not overcrowd ponds,
            Use medicines or probiotics only after consulting experts
            </p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>8. Harvesting Methods</h2>
            <p>Harvesting is done when fish or shrimp reach market size. 
                Drain the pond partially and use nets to catch them carefully. 
                Avoid rough handling to maintain quality.
                After harvesting, clean the pond before starting the next cycle.
